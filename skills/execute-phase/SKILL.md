# Execute Phase

Execute the approved plan.

## Guidelines
- Follow the plan step by step
- Run tests after implementing each major feature
- Pause and report if you encounter blockers
- Mark each task complete as you finish it

## When to Use
- After a phase plan has been approved
- User says "execute the plan", "implement the plan", "start building", "let's build this"
- User says "start implementing", "time to code"
- Ready to write code for an approved phase

## When NOT to Use
- No plan exists yet (use `/plan-phase` first)
- Still making technology decisions (use `/tech-stack` instead)
- Just want to commit completed work (use `/commit-phase` instead)
