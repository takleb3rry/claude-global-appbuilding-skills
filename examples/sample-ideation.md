## 5. Assumptions Log

| ID | Assumption | Category | Importance | Confidence | Evidence | Validation Strategy |
|----|------------|----------|------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| A1 | [Assumption text] | Problem | High | Low | [What we found] | [How to validate] |
| A2 | [Assumption text] | User | High | Medium | [What we found] | [How to validate] |
| A3 | [Assumption text] | Market | Medium | High | [What we found] | [How to validate] |

- **Target Segment**: [Primary user segment]
- **Validates Assumptions**: A1, A4
- **Key Risks**: [What could go wrong]
- **Prior Art**: [Similar attempts found in research, lessons learned]

### Hypothesis 2: [Name]
- **Description**: [What it is and how it works]
- **Key Differentiator**: [What makes it unique]
- **Target Segment**: [Primary user segment]
- **Validates Assumptions**: A2, A3
